    <div class="q-body-1">Aksharamukha is now available as a docker container. Please follow the below steps to run Aksharamukha locally in your system.</div>
    <div class="q-body-1">
      <h5> Configure Docker </h5>
      <ul>
        <li> Install Docker for Windows from <a href="https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe">here</a>. In case the link is broken, please download it from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Dockerhub</a>.
        </li>
        <li> Run Docker Desktop after installation. There must be a Desktop icon for the same. Alternatively, search for Docker, and select Docker Desktop in the search results.
        </li>
        <li> Close the dialog that tells you this: Docker is already running and fully functional. It will also ask you to login. You can safely ignore it.</li>
        <li> Now you're all setup to use Docker. Docker will now start automatically with Windows.</li>

      </ul>
      <h5> Running Aksharamukha </h5>
       <ul>
        <li> Download the <a href="https://github.com/virtualvinodh/aksharamukha/blob/master/aksharamukha-offline.zip?raw=true">zip file</a> and extract it somewhere convenient. Do not separate the files. They should be in the same folder. </li>
        <li> Please make sure the whale icon in the status bar stays steady before proceeding (This ensures docker is up and running).
        <li> Windows might prevent you from running the below files. If that occurs, please select <i>More info</i> and click on <i>Run anyway</i>. </li>
        <li> Open  <i> install aksharamukha</i> to install. It will attempt to download the necessary files and setup everything. This initial setup may last a while depending on your connection speed. Eventually, the screen will close after the installation.</li>
        <li> Once everything is installed, open <i>run Aksharamukha</i>. This should open a new browser window. Aksharamukha is now available locally at: <i>http://localhost:12345</i>.</li>
        <li> If you want to stop Aksharamukha, open <i>stop Aksharamukha</i>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5> Updating Aksharamukha </h5>

      <div class="q-body-1">You can update the local copy of Aksharamukha by clicking on the <i> install aksharamukha </i> file again. This updates the local copy in case there are new updates. It is probabably useful to update your copy every couple of months at least.</div>
